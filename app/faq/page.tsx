            <p>
              DropYard is your neighbourhood yard sale, online. Neighbours list
              things they no longer need, other neighbours claim them, and the two
              of you arrange a quick in-person pickup — usually at the seller&apos;s
              porch or driveway.
            </p>

              So we can confirm you&apos;re in Barrhaven. DropYard is a hyperlocal
              community, and the whole experience falls apart if listings come from
              far away — pickup wouldn&apos;t be a quick walk or drive anymore.

              We use your location to verify you&apos;re in the service area, not

            We don&apos;t give tax advice, but generally: occasional sales of your

            you&apos;re selling regularly enough that it looks like a business —
            many items each month, brand-new stock, etc. — the Canada Revenue
            Agency may treat it differently. When in doubt, ask an accountant.
